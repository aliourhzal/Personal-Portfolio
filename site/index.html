				<h2>Here's a time line of james webb's career</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><span>1989:</span> The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and NASA co-host the Next Generation Space Telescope Workshop at STScI. </li>
					<li><span>1995-1996:</span> An STScI committee recommends a significantly larger telescope capable of observing infrared light. </li>
					<li><span>1997:</span> NASA selects teams from the Goddard Space Flight Center, TRW, and Ball Aerospace to fine-tune the telescope's technical and financial requirements. </li>
					<li><span>1999:</span> Lockheed Martin, Ball Aerospace, and TRW (also partnering with Kodak and ATK) conduct Phase A mission studies </li>
					<li><span>2002:</span> Based on two Phase A studies, NASA selects the design of TRW/Ball Aerospace to continue in Phase B detailed design studies, which examine the performance and cost of the chosen design.</li>
					<li><span>2004:</span> Construction begins on certain telescope parts that require extensive, long-term work-in particular, Webb's science instruments and the 18 segments of the primary mirro</li>
					<li><span>2005:</span> NASA approves the use of the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket to launch Webb into space.. </li>
					<li><span>2009:</span> The Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) structure, built to house Webb's four science instruments, arrives at Goddard Space Flight Center for testing.</li>
					<li><span>2014:</span> Manufacturing of the spacecraft parts (such as fuel tanks, gyroscopes, and solar panels) begins.</li>
					<li><span>2017:</span> The Optical Telescope Element successfully undergoes cryogenic testing in a giant thermal vacuum chamber called Chamber A at Johnson Space Center.</li>
					<li><span>2020:</span> Webb is fully folded for the first time and completes final environmental testing to prove it can withstand the shaking and jostling of the launch environment.</li>
					<li><span>2021:</span> ASA's James Webb Space Telescope is launched December 25 at 7:20 a.m. EST on an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana.</li>
